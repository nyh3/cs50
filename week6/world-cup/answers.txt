Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small prediction sometimes Brazil has a higher chance of winning but with
larger simulation Belgium is one with the highest chance of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilised after about 10000 simulations.
